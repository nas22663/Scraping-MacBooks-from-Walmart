Scraping MacBooks from Walmart
This project is designed to scrape information about MacBook listings from Walmart's website. It captures details such as product names, prices, and URLs. This can be particularly useful for data analysis, price monitoring, or simply keeping track of the available MacBook models on Walmart.

Project Setup
Prerequisites
Before you get started, ensure you have Python installed on your system. This project is built using Scrapy, a powerful tool for web scraping written in Python.

Installing Scrapy
If you haven't installed Scrapy yet, you can do so by running the following command in your terminal:

pip install scrapy
For detailed installation instructions, refer to the official Scrapy documentation.

Installing Splash
For rendering JavaScript and dynamic content on Walmart's website, this project uses Splash. Follow the steps below to install and run Splash:

Docker Installation
Splash is easiest to run as a Docker container. If you don't have Docker installed, follow the official Docker installation guide.

Once Docker is installed, run the following command to pull and start the Splash Docker container:

docker run -p 8050:8050 scrapinghub/splash
This command downloads the Splash image and starts a Splash server on port 8050. Ensure the Splash server is running before executing the spider.

Scrapy-Splash Setup
After setting up Splash, you need to integrate it with Scrapy using the Scrapy-Splash middleware. First, install the scrapy-splash Python package:

pip install scrapy-splash
Next, configure Scrapy to use Scrapy-Splash by updating your project's settings.py file. Add or update the following settings:

python
Copy code
# Enable or add Splash to the downloader middleware
DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES = {
    'scrapy_splash.SplashCookiesMiddleware': 723,
    'scrapy_splash.SplashMiddleware': 725,
    'scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpcompression.HttpCompressionMiddleware': 810,
}

# Set the Splash URL
SPLASH_URL = 'http://localhost:8050'

# Use a custom DUPEFILTER_CLASS
DUPEFILTER_CLASS = 'scrapy_splash.SplashAwareDupeFilter'

# Add a custom cache storage backend
HTTPCACHE_STORAGE = 'scrapy_splash.SplashAwareFSCacheStorage'
With these settings in place, your Scrapy project is ready to use Splash for rendering JavaScript-heavy pages.

Running the Spider
To run the spider and start scraping, navigate to the project directory and run:

bash
Copy code
scrapy crawl walmart_macbooks -o output.json
This command will execute the walmart_macbooks spider and save the scraped data to output.json. You can specify a different output file name or format as needed (e.g., output.csv for CSV format).

Important Notes
This project scrapes data using dynamic rendering techniques to capture JavaScript-rendered content on the page. It employs Scrapy and additional tools like Splash to render pages.
The spider is set to scrape multiple pages of MacBook listings, but it's important to note that the completeness and accuracy of the captured data have not been extensively tested. It is possible that not all content is captured due to the dynamic nature of Walmart's website and potential changes in its structure or anti-scraping measures.
Please use this spider responsibly and consider Walmart's robots.txt file and Terms of Service to avoid putting undue stress on their servers or scraping content they have disallowed.
Contributing
Contributions to improve the spider or extend its capabilities are welcome. Please feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
